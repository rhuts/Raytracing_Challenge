# Raytracing

![Diffuse Material Sphere Render](https://github.com/rhuts/Raytracing_Challenge/blob/master/media/raytracing_diffuse_matrial_sphere.png)

## Goals of The Challenge (Based on [course](https://raytracing.github.io/) by Peter Shirley)
- [x] Implement raytracing in __ONE__ weekend (3 days)
- [x] Learn the fundamentals of path tracers and expand on them further

## Additional Continuous Development (In Progress)
- [x] Render to the screen instead of writing out to a PPM image
- [ ] Implement and switch between additional rendering methods using hotkey
  - [x] Single threaded *(CPU)*
  - [x] Multi-threaded *(CPU)*
  - [ ] Compute Shader *(GPU)*


## Getting Started
1. Build the Visual Studio solution `Raytracing.sln`
1. Run
1. Press `'Q'` key to quit
1. Press `'M'` key to switch rendering modes
