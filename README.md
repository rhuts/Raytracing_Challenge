## Goals of This Project
- Implement raytracing in one weekend (3 days)
- Based on the course by Peter Shirley [here](https://raytracing.github.io/)
- Additionally, render to the screen instead of writing out to a PPM image
- Also, dynamically change rendering parameters / styles / etc. with hotkeys
- And, make it multithreaded
